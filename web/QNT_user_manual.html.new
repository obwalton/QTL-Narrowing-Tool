    <h2>Purpose and Significance</h2>
    <p>Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are regions of DNA that are closely linked to the genes that
	underlie a diseases-causing trait. Yet, due to the usually large size DNA regions it remains 
	difficult to narrow the QTL and isolate the genes in a labor- and time-efficient manner. The 
	QTL Narrowing Tool (QNT) is a web-based application that performs QTL narrowing by integrating 
	several bioinformatics tools. Our QNT tool is intended to substitute the manual QTL narrowing 
	process and to standardize the methodology. The significant advantage of the QNT over manual 
	QTL narrowing is its time- and labor-efficiency due to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the utilization of a user-defined QTL list and sequence and expression database
			information in one standardized tool;</li>
        <li>the automatic and gene-centered inter-species genome conversion
			(not available in the alpha version).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Warning:</b> The QNT tool is primarily intended to accelerate the QTL narrowing process. The
	isolated genes should undergo further verification experiments with state-of-the-art laboratory 
	techniques before they can be argued to be candidate genes.

<h2>Overview: How does QNT work?</h2>
<h3>Input data by the user:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A user-defined list of QTL (mandatory). To find instructions about how to prepare
			the QTL list please click <a href="#prepare">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A user defined microarray expression data set (optional). Instead of using
			user-defined expression microarray data (not available in the alpha version) the user 
			has the option to choose one of the provided microarray data sets. To find information 
			about the available microarray data please click here.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The step-by-step procedures performed by QNT are:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Generation of the smallest common region(s) of the genome between overlapping QTLs
			within species.</li>
    <li>Haplotype analysis for the smallest common region(s) within the mouse genome.</li>
    <li>Inter-species genome conversions and identification of the smallest common region(s)
			between-species (not available in the alpha version).</li> 
    <li>Identification of all polymorphic SNPs within the final smallest common region(s).</li>
    <li>Identification of all homologous genes within the final smallest common region(s)
			between species (not available in the alpha version).</li>
    <li>Annotation of all polymorphic SNPs using the CGDSNPdb (Center for Genome Dynamic
			SNP database) annotations and association with genes.</li> 
    <li>Association with probe set IDs using the MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) database.</li>
    <li>Annotation of each gene with gene expression information from the microarray data
			sets (only if specified).</li>
</ol>
<a name="region"></a>
<h3>The results provided by QNT are presented in 3 tables:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>A Region Table.</b> This table lists the final smallest common region(s) identified by
			the QTL narrowing process. The information provided in the region table is: the base 
			pair range of each region, the QTL that were narrowed, the total number of SNPs within 
			the region, the number of polymorphic SNPs, and the identified genes. The base pair 
			range provides a link to the UCSC (University of California at Santa Cruz) Genome 
			Browser for the identified base pair range. The genes within each region are then the 
			entry to the next table:</li>
    <a name="gene"></a>
    <li><b>The Gene Table.</b> This table lists each gene within a narrowed region from the region
			table. The information provided in the region table is: the gene&#146s symbol and name, a 
			link to the individual MGI gene detail page, and the number of polymorphic SNPs within 
			the gene. If mircoarray data were used for the narrowing process the mean intensities 
			of the high (quantitatively higher trait value) and low (quantitatively lower trait 
			value) responding strains as well as the P-value of their difference are given. The 
			polymorphic SNPs within each gene are then the entry to the next table:</li>
    <a name="snp"></a>
    <li><b>The SNP Table.</b> This table lists all the polymorphic SNPs within a gene from the gene
			table. The information provided in the region table is: the SNP&#146s base pair position, 
			the high (higher trait value) and low (lower trait value) responder allele, the rs 
			number (rs numbers are taken from the CGDSNPdb), a secondary SNP ID and its source, and 
			the SNP&#146s annotation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step-by-step guidance for the use of the QNT</h2>
<p>The web-based interface of QNT is located <a href="http://jaxbhqtl1-prod.jax.org:8080/QTLNarrowing/">here.</a></p>

<p>To successfully use QNT, please follow the provided steps below:</p> 
<a name="qtlprep"></a>

<h3>Generate the input QTL list</h3>
<p>There are 3 option of how a QTL list can be generated:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Upload a user-defined QTL list.</li>
    <ul><a name="prepare"></a>
        <li>Prepare and save the QTL list file on the local work station of the used
					computer. To prepare a QTL list file follow these requirements for the custom 
					QTL list file:
            <ul>
                <li>The file needs to be .txt formatted (tab-delimited).</li>
                <li>The file should NOT include a header line.</li>
                <li>The file should include information in the first eight columns as
							follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>QTL ID:</b> a specific ID to identify the QTL in comparison to
									other QTL used in the same list: the ID is for the users purpose 
									only and does not have to be the published QTL ID.</li>
                        <li><b>Phenotype:</b> the phenotype which was used to identify the QTL;
									the phenotype is for the users purpose;</li>
                        <li><b>Species:</b> the species in which the QTL was identified; for
									the current version you can choose Mouse;</li>
                        <li><b>High Resp Strain:</b> strain name of the strain with the
									quantitatively higher phenotype; a list of valid strain names 
									is available <a href="/QTLNarrowing/strains.txt">here.</a></li>
                        <li><b>Low Resp Strain:</b> strain name of the strain with the
									quantitatively lower phenotype; a list of valid strain names 
									is available <a href="/QTLNarrowing/strains.txt">here.</a></li>
                        <li><b>Chr:</b> chromosome (only numerical, for example: chromosome 1
									needs to be a &#147 1 &#148 not a &#147chr1&#148 or &#147Chr1&#148);</li>
                        <li><b>QTL Start:</b> start position of the QTL or 95% confidence
									interval (in base pairs (bp));</li>
                        <li><b>QTL End:</b> end position of the QTL or 95% confidence interval
									(in base pairs (pb))</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To upload the QTL list file:
            <ol>
                <li>Click the &#147Choose File&#148 button.</li>
                <li>Browse to the directory the QTL list file is saved.</li>
                <li>Select the QTL list file.</li>
                <li>Click the &#147Upload&#148 button.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Search the MGI database for QTL of interest. (not available in the alpha version)
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the &#147Search MGI&#148 button.</li>
            <li>Select the phenotype(s) of interest.</li>
            <li>Upload the isolated QTL list by clicking on the &#147Upload QTL List&#148 button.</li>
            <li>Click &#147Upload&#148 button.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Combine option 1. and 2. (not available in the alpha version)
        <ol>
            <li>Follow step 1. and 2. above.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<a name="qtllist"></a>

<h3>Modify the input QTL list table</h3>
<p>Once the QTL list table is generated it can be modified in several ways to verify the 
		correctness of the uploaded data and to modify its content. The following modifications are 
		possible:
<ul>
    <li><b>Sort:</b> By clicking on the header of each column a drop-down menu appears, from
				which sorting (ascending or descending) can be performed.</li>
    <li><b>Content:</b> By clicking on the header of each column a drop-down menu appears.
				When &#147Columns&#148 are selected another drop-down menu will open containing all header 
				names in the table. By checking or un-checking the box next to a column header name 
				the visibility of this column can be changed to visible or invisible, respectively. 
				Un-checking column header names does not delete the information in the columns.</li>
    <li><b>Strain names:</b> The spelling of the strain names is crucial for the successful
				performance of QNT. Incorrectly spelled strains will appear in red font. To correct 
				the strain name please click on the individual strain cell and select the strain of 
				interest from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><b>Scroll:</b> Please ensure that you scroll through the entire QTL list to detect
				possible missing data or spelling errors. In case a spelling error was missed the 
				narrowing process will not start and a dialog box will appear with the request to 
				reevaluate the QTL list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Microarray data input</h3>
<p>The purpose of using microarray expression data is to provide an integrated mechanism to 
		identify those genes that &#150 besides being isolated due to incorporation of polymorphic SNPs 
		within the smallest QTL region(s) &#150 are differentially expressed between high and low 
		responding strains.</p>

<p><b>Attention:</b> Current microarray experiments are only available for lung and liver tissues 
		of selected strains (see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Cross tissue comparison have to be interpreted with care!
		Further laboratory evaluations are suggested.</p>

<p>The following options of incorporating microarray data in QNT are possible:
<ol>
    <li><b>Select one of the available microarray data sets from the drop-down menu.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In the current version of the QNT we provide gene expression microarray
		data from both liver and lung that were obtained from several strains. The age
                and gender of the mice, the diet that was fed to the mice, and the strains
                used for the microarray experiments are summarized below in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>For lung tissue analysis we used Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
                        The average signal intensities for each probe set within each array
                        were calculated using the RMA summarization method provided within
                        the Affymetrix package for R using a custom (Entrez Gene)  CDF (Chip 
                        Description File) file.  Following is a brief summary of the lung tissue gene expression experiment:
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>Five female mice from 12 inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, BALB/cJ,
                                C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CE/J, DBA/2J, C57L/J, KK/HlJ, MRL/MpJ, PWD/PhJ and
                                SJL/J) were fed a standard diet (6% fat, product 5K52 from LabDiets,
                                St. Louis, MO) until 11 weeks of age. Gene expression was measured using
                                Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays, with 3 animals per treatment group.</code>
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>For the liver tissue gene expression data we have provided the options to use either the
                        entire liver data set or subsets depending on the fed diet.  Details  regarding the liver tissue
                        gene expression experiment was extracted from the CGD web-site at: <a href="http://cgd.jax.org/datasets/expression/10strain.shtml">http://cgd.jax.org/datasets/expression/10strain.shtml</a>.
                        In brief:
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>Ten male and ten female mice from 12 inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, BALB/cJ,
                            C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, DBA/2J, I/LnJ, MRL/MpJ-Tnfrsf6lpr/J, NZB/BINJ, 
                            PERA/Ei, and SM/J) were fed a standard diet (6% fat, product 5K52 from LabDiets,
                            St. Louis, MO) until at least 6 weeks of age, and were then evenly divided into 
                            two dietary groups for a 4 week period. Five animals from each strain and sex 
                            were fed an atherogenic high-fat diet (30% Kcal from dairy fat) containing by 
                            weight 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid to increase cholesterol uptake, while
                            the remaining animals were kept on the standard diet. Gene expression was 
                            measured using Affymetrix Mouse 430 v2 arrays, with 3 animals per treatment 
                            group. For additional information, see Shockley et al. 2009 or Burgess-Herbert

		done. You are still able to use your browser, but selecting another tab, or opening another 
		window but the specific tab the analysis is running in will be blocked until the narrowing 
		is completed.</p>

                <p>The time required to narrow a QTL list depends of the number of QTLs and the overlap
		between QTLs.</p>

                <p>If the narrowing does not start a dialog box will appear letting you know the error.
		Please correct the error and click &#147Narrow QTLs&#148 again.</p>

                <p>You have also the option to upload a new QTL list after clearing the QTL list table by
		clicking the &#147Clear&#148 button.</p>

                <h2>Additional functionality of the QNT for future releases</h2>
                <p>Some of the functionality of the tool is not yet implemented for the current alpha-release.
	We currently work on the following additions to the QNT:
                <ul>
                    <li>Major additions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adding support for Strain synonyms: The user will have the option to use well
					known/used synonyms of strains. For example, if someone would enter"B6" we will assume 
					the user means C57BL/6J. The user will still have the option to edit incorect spelling 
					as currently available.</li>
                            <li>Adding phenotype search to obtain a QTL lists from MGI: In the furture the user will have
					the option to assable a QTL list by way of searching the currently published QTL available
					online.</li>
                            <li>Adding options to download the result files (excel or tab delimited reports): In the
					future the user will have the option to download all result files for further modifications
					or analysis steps.</li>
                            <li>Add Cross Species functionality: In the future the user will be able to use evidence
					from multiple species by integrating the functionality of cross-species conversion. </li>
                            <li>Add user provided microarray experiments and support for more micoarray platforms:
					In the future we will provide the opportunity to upload microarray experiments. Also, we
					anticipate to support more than the currently available two affymetrix platforms.</li>
                            <li>Add GWAS support: We will implement the function to include genome-wide association
					mapping results (and possibly analyses if strain survey data are provided) from the mouse.</li>
                            <li>Enhance liver/Shockley data to break out by gender as well:</li>
                            <li>Add threading to back end and perform analysis by chromosome to improve performance
					(meaning multiple chromosomes for one analysis could run at the same time).  This may 
					require a bigger server but should improve performance on processing of data with many chromosomes.</li>	
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Minor additions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>For GEX radio buttons, make &#147options&#148 only appear if the user selects that radio
					button:</li>
                            <li>Fix width/height/message of processing dialog.</li>
                            <li>Add an option to exclude snp annotation types from the result.</li>
                            <li>Include Gene Start and End position in the gene table.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
	We would appreciate any additional suggestions to improve the efficiency and the functionality of the 
	QNT.</p>
